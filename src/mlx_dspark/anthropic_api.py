"""Anthropic Messages API (``/v1/messages``) — the dialect **Claude Code** speaks.

Claude Code talks to whatever ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` points at using Anthropic's Messages
API, *not* the OpenAI one, so an OpenAI-compatible server is invisible to it. This module is
the translation layer: Anthropic request -> the OpenAI-shaped message list the rest of
mlx-dspark already speaks (:func:`~mlx_dspark.generate.encode_messages` +
:func:`~mlx_dspark.tools.normalize_tool_messages`), and generated text -> Anthropic content
blocks / SSE events.

Everything here is **pure and model-free** (no MLX, no weights) so the whole surface is
unit-testable; ``server.py`` owns the HTTP plumbing.

What the contract actually requires (Anthropic's own gateway-protocol reference,
`code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol`) and how we satisfy it:

* **``POST /v1/messages``, streaming.** Claude Code posts to ``/v1/messages?beta=true`` — match
  on the *path*, not the full URL — and consumes SSE as it arrives; a server that buffers the
  whole response before relaying stalls the client. :class:`MessageStream` emits events at
  round granularity.
* **``POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`` is optional** — without it Claude Code estimates context
  usage locally. We serve it (exact for the loaded tokenizer, and it costs a tokenizer call).
* **Unknown request fields must not 400.** Claude Code sends capabilities that grow every
  release (``thinking``, ``context_management``, ``output_config``, beta tool-schema fields
  like ``strict``/``defer_loading``, ``cache_control`` markers, ``metadata``…) and treats model
  names it doesn't recognize — which includes every name a local server serves — as current
  models that get the newest fields. So we read the fields we implement and **ignore the rest**
  rather than validating; a strict parser here breaks on a Claude Code release we've never seen.
* **Error bodies are matched on wording.** Claude Code's auto-compact-and-retry fires on
  Anthropic's ``prompt is too long`` phrasing, so :func:`context_overflow_error` reproduces it
  verbatim — a local model's short window then behaves like a context limit the client knows
  how to recover from, instead of a hard failure.

Reasoning models are the second thing that needs unpacking: Qwen3 and friends wrap their
chain of thought in ``<think>…</think>`` *inside the generated text*, while Anthropic carries
it as a separate ``thinking`` content block. Left alone the raw markup renders as assistant
prose in Claude Code, so we split it out (:func:`split_thinking`) and emit a real thinking
block — or drop it when the client asked for ``thinking: {"type": "disabled"}``.

Tool calls are the one lossy join. The models we serve emit calls in their own syntax
(Hermes ``<tool_call>{json}</tool_call>`` for Qwen3, Gemma-4's bespoke form) which is only
parseable once complete, while Anthropic streams ``tool_use`` blocks as partial JSON. We
stream text right up to the first tool-call marker (:class:`_ToolGate` holds back just enough
tail to catch a marker split across rounds), then buffer and emit whole ``tool_use`` blocks at
the end. Text streams live; tool calls arrive atomically — which is what a client can act on
anyway.
