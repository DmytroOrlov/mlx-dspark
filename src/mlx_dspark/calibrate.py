"""Hardware-aware auto-calibration for the speculative cap (``--max-draft auto``).

Why this exists: on Apple Silicon the verify cost is NOT linear in the number of tokens
verified per round — it is convex with a machine/model-dependent knee (measured on
gemma-4-12B-8bit / M4 Pro: ~5 ms/tok for widths 1–3, then +19 ms for the 4th, where MLX's
quantized matmul leaves its cheap few-rows path for GEMM tiling; see NOTES "Perf pass 2").
So the optimal cap is a property of the (machine, target, drafter) triple and moves across
chip generations. Instead of a hard-coded default, measure the cost curves once per pair
(a few seconds, cached on disk) and let a small controller pick the cap that maximizes
expected tokens/second under a live acceptance estimate.

Pieces:
  * ``measure_verify_curve`` / ``measure_dspark_drafter_curve`` / ``measure_dflash_drafter_cost``
    — warm synthetic-forward timings. Content-independent (pure compute), so a constant token
    id is fine; the caches are trimmed back between iterations so every timing sees the same state.
  * ``CapController`` — per-*position* conditional acceptance EWMA. Each round contributes
    Bernoulli observations (n successes, plus one failure unless the block was fully accepted,
    which is censored), so rounds run at ANY cap update the same estimate; expected committed
    tokens at a candidate cap C is the geometric extrapolation 1 + Σ_{i<=C} p^i. The cap picked
    is argmax of committed / (drafter(C) + verify(C+1)), with hysteresis against flapping.
  * ``calibrate`` — measure-or-load with a JSON disk cache keyed by device, mlx version, mode,
    and model basenames.

Correctness: the cap only chooses how many drafted tokens are *verified* per round — the
backbone always drafts full-width and the target verifies every emitted token — so output is
lossless for ANY per-round cap sequence. Auto-cap can never change what is generated.

    (model x QUANTIZATION x chip x mlx version), not of the model family. Measured
    2026-07-22 on one M4 Pro under mlx 0.32, the best cap spans **2 to 7** across the
    cached curves, and the *same registry row* needs different caps per quantization —
    Ornith-1.0-9B wants cap 2 at 4-bit, 4 at 8-bit, 6 at bf16 — while drafter resolution
    is deliberately quant-agnostic, so no per-entry constant can express it. Nor is a
    knee-derived rule enough: bf16 has a 2x cliff at width 2 and is then FLAT, so the
    right move there is to go *wide* once the cliff is paid. What generalizes is the
    argmax itself, which reproduced all 7 documented optima. The old hardcoded 2 was
    measured when mlx 0.31.2 put the knee at width 4; 0.32 moved it to 6 for every 8-bit
    family, leaving 10-32% on the table. It will drift again — that is the point.
