"""Prefix KV caching for the OpenAI server — skip re-prefilling a shared conversation prefix.

A multi-turn request's prompt is (almost) the previous prompt + the assistant's reply + the new
user turn, so the bulk of it was already computed last turn. This keeps the target KV cache (and,
for DSpark, the drafter's context cache) from recent conversations and, on the next request,
reuses the entry with the longest common prefix: trim the caches back to it and prefill only the
new suffix.

Two reuse modes, because "can this cache be rolled back?" and "can this cache be reused?" are
different questions:

  * **trim** (default) — trim the stored caches back to an arbitrary earlier position and
    prefill the rest. Exact for a plain ``KVCache`` (Qwen3). A ``RotatingKVCache`` (Gemma-4's
    sliding-window layers) is linear — identical to a plain cache — until it first wraps at
    ``max_size``; mlx-lm's own ``is_trimmable()`` encodes exactly this.
  * **checkpoint** — snapshot the caches at a **boundary** and reuse them only at exactly
    that length. This needs no rollback at all, so it works for the caches trim mode has to
    refuse: a hybrid target's linear-attention state (recurrent, no trim) and a wrapped
    rotating window. It is exact for the same reason ``Target.rollback`` is: the state after
    k tokens is a function of the first k tokens only, so a snapshot taken there is precisely
    what a cold prefill of that prefix would produce.

    Reuse is all-or-nothing at a snapshot position, so *where* the snapshots sit is the whole
    game. Three kinds of position, all chosen by the server (see ``Engine``):

      - the **stable prompt boundary** — the prompt boundary minus the few trailing
        generation-prompt tokens that do not survive into the next turn's re-rendered
        transcript (Qwen3.6-class templates prefill a ``<think>`` opener that the completed
        turn renders differently; snapshotting at the full boundary made every multi-turn
        request miss by 2–4 tokens). Snapshotting at least one token *below* the prompt
        boundary also makes a byte-identical repeat (regenerate/retry) a hit: the loop
        re-forwards the unstable tail and gets its logits, which a snapshot at the exact
        boundary cannot provide.
      - **rungs** — interior positions (chunk-spaced during prefill, plus the boundaries of
        superseded slots) at which only the *non-trimmable* layer states are kept. The
        trimmable layers (a hybrid's attention KV, the drafter ctx) reuse the slot's full
        snapshot trimmed back to the rung — KV rows are position-local, so that is exact.
        This is what makes reuse *partial* for hybrid/recurrent targets: a request that
        diverges from a cached conversation mid-way (new session on the same system prompt,
        compacted history) reuses the longest rung under the divergence instead of missing
        outright.
      - an **anchor** — when a request misses (or lands on a shallow rung) but shared a long
        prefix with some slot, ``acquire`` remembers that LCP and the server snapshots a rung
        there during this request's prefill, so the *next* request from that fan-out pattern
        hits at the exact divergence point.

Mode is not a user choice: checkpoint is forced on for targets whose caches are not trimmable
at all, and switched on adaptively for a rotating-window target the first time a store is
refused because the window wrapped (so gemma-4 pays the snapshot only once it needs it).
  * **dspark + lookup + baseline modes.** DFlash's drafter keeps its own cache that can't roll
    back, so it isn't reused here.
  * **A small LRU of conversations** (default 2 slots) — so an agent process and a chat window
    hitting the same server don't evict each other every turn. Still not a multi-tenant KV pool.

Losslessness: reuse is lossless to the same standard as the rest of mlx-dspark — the output is a
valid decoding of the target, differing from a cold run only at logit-margin≈0 ties (fp
nondeterminism between chunked and single-pass prefill). An in-flight entry is only re-validated
by ``store()``, so a generation error can never leave a cache desynced from the token record it
claims to represent.

Optional **L2 SSD spill**: when the slots' total RAM exceeds a byte budget, least-recent slots
are serialized to a directory (target KV via mlx-lm's ``save_prompt_cache``, drafter ctx as
safetensors) and dropped from RAM, reloaded on their next reuse.
